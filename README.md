## Philosophy and Mathematics

I'm also interested in philosophy and mathematics, and I believe that these interests have helped me to approach programming in a unique and effective way. The process of constructing a logical and optimal structure in philosophy is similar to building the superstructure of a website, and my background in mathematics has given me the ability to approach problems from multiple perspectives and angles.
